### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to be able to purchase play time for a dog! Growing up, I've always wanted a dog but was never allowed to have one because my family didn't want one. Moreover, now that I'm older and never have any free time, adopting a dog isn't feasible. There are probably many others out there like me: individuals who wish they had a dog but can't feasibly adopt one. As a result, the purpose of this website is to act as a marketplace for people to purchase play time with a dog! Each dog added to the cart is 10 minutes worth of play time.

### Usability Principles Considered
I decided to include all of the filtering and sorting buttons on the left side of the screen as this is typically what I've seen from several other marketplaces (for example, Amazon), thus users would be familiar with this convention. Moreover, I included what the user was filtering/sorting on at the top of the page above all of the filtering and sorting buttons so that it would be abundantly clear to the users what cards were being displayed. The cart is at the very bottom of the left hand panel intentionally, as I've noticed from several retail sites that the carts are usually hidden (either you have to click into a different webpage or you have to hover over an icon). This may in part be due to the fact that if people can see how many items are in their cart and what the total cost is, they will be less inclined to add more items to their cart due to the fact that they may feel guilty for having a high total cost. 

In terms of the actual dog cards themselves, I formatted them so that all of the information that users can sort/filter them by were displayed clearly on the cards. Organization wise, I wanted to keep the text seperate from the photos (as opposed to overlaid on the photos) to make it super clear. Because everything on this website fits on one webpage, I decided to put the remove item on each dog card itself as opposed to in the aggregator (the cart) as spacially this fit better. I did not think this would affect usability since again, the cart and dog items are on the same page. 


### Organization of Components


### How Data is Passed Down Through Components
Data is passed down through components via props. 

### How the User Triggers State Changes
The user triggers state changes when they decide to press any of the buttons on the website, namely:
1. Sorting
2. Filtering
3. Cart modification
